### Regression Models with Automobile MPG Data 
---
#### In Regression Models, I use both a Regression Model and a Lasso Regression Model on CSV of automobile mpg data.
#### After preparing and exploring the data using some basic visualization techniques, I train and model the data, setting MPG as the target variable. Once modeled, I check for the R-Squared Score, Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error in order to explore the models' predictive abilities
