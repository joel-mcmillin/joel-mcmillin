### API Work using Project Gutenberg, OMDB (movie database) and Twitter
---
#### In this project, I am working with APIs and BeautifulSoup
#### In the first portion, I use BeautifulSoup to parse HTML information on the Project Gutenberg site to find the top 100 most popular books on Project Gutenberg
#### The second portion allows a user to search for OMDB information about movie titles entered.
#### Finally, in the last portion, using a Twitter API, I link to a username created for this project to then pull the most recent Tweets about Ukraine. This was particularly relevant given the frequency of Twitter searches about Ukraine in early/mid 2022.
