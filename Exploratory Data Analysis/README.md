## **Exploratory Data Analysis - AirBnb Data (2016-2021)**

This was an early Data Science project from DSC530, and it involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

I used AirBnb data from NYC that included pricing, rental property type, number of reviews, reviews per month, and date of last review to look for any trends in the data. This was of interest to me because of the timeframe for the data, which has early AirBnb data up through the pandemic that started in early 2020. The data runs through late 2021, when vaccine availability led to increased travel and use of AirBnb properties.

The EDA used here involves exploring and visualizing relationships between the different data points.

For this, I mostly relied on thinkplot and thinkstats2. I used histographs and scatter plots to visually explore the data. I used Probability Mass Function (PMF) to investigate whether the variable relationships were random or not. Pearsons and Spearmans Correlation coeffients were used to investigate the strength of any correlations. I also used single (Least Squares) and multiple regression analysis (OLS Regression), also to investigate the strength of correlation between variables in the data.

Notable findings were that there appears to be an increase in AirBnb use/spending/reviews toward the end of 2021. This is noticeable because the increase shows more use/spending/reviews after the pandemic than at any point before the pandemic. This prompts the question of Why that may be. Is this consumers wanted to travel as soon as restrictions started to lift? Were prices lowered in hopes of greater demand? Was the reverse true? These questions weren't investigated as part of this EDA project, but would make a great follow-up, especially now that the AirBnb market is cooling.
